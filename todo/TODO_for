1. Implement the following for LINCOA, BOBYQA. It has been done for COBYLA, NEWUOA, UOBYQA.
See cobylb.f90, newuob.f90, uobyqb.f90 for reference.
If X is close to one of the points in the interpolation set, then we do not evaluate the
objective and constraints at X, assuming them to have the values at the closest point.
N.B.: If this happens, do NOT include X into the filter, as F and CONSTR are inaccurate.

After this, turn on the checking that "XHIST does not contain a repeating segment". See history.f90.
